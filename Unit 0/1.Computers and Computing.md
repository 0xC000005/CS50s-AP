## Overview
A computer, in the most general sense, is just a device that **accepts data or input**, and
processes it in some way to automatically **produce a result**. 

When a computer is doing **any kind of work**, whether it’s opening an application, editing an image, or playing a song, it is **computing**. Computing, in the most general sense, means calculating. 

In order for a computer to operate correctly, many different parts of the computer have
to communicate and interact with one another in just the right way.

### Inputs and Outputs
**A computer starts by taking in some sort of data or information**, called input. 

Input can take a variety of forms—mouse clicks, keyboard presses, taps on a touch screen, or button presses, for instance. 
Input can also take less traditional forms: such as the way [smoke detectors](https://youtu.be/oFUUQcpGR3k](https://youtu.be/oFUUQcpGR3k
)(油管国内看不了，主要就是讲了烟雾探测器是通过光学化学反应当作input的就对了) take in information from the environment, or the way cars take input from a steering wheel in order to determine which way to turn.

Computers **use the inputs provided to them in order to generate a result**. 
In computer science, this result is called the output. In the case of a traditional desktop computer, output might take the form of whatever is displayed on the user’s screen. But output can take many other forms, such as producing sound or causing motion.

Somehow, computers need to translate inputs into outputs, by processing the information in the input in order to generate the necessary output. This processing takes the form of an **algorithm**, which is just a set of rules that a computer must follow in order to translate inputs into the desired outputs. 

**Programming is the process of providing a computer with a set of instructions, or an algorithm, in order to perform a particular task.**

### The Computational Process
**The process of translating inputs into outputs is known as the computational process**, and will likely involve performing a series of calculations in the form of an algorithm.
The computational process can range in its complexity and in the number of steps required to complete a task. Sometimes, the computational process is relatively simple, like the process of calculating 5+3. In other cases, many computational tasks are much more complicated. **All tasks computers perform, like a GPS calculating a route from home to work, or an alarm going off at a certain time, require computation.** 
计算机必须要经过computational process计算步骤才能把input变成output，不然没有计算步骤也就不叫计算机了XD

### How Computers Work
Each part of the computer serves a specific function, and together they allow for computers to perform tasks.
**Computers require a combination of hardware, the physical parts that make up the computer, and software, the programs and instructions that run on the computer.**
Much of a computer’s hardware is attached to the computer’s motherboard (or logic board 主板), which contains the hardware that helps different parts of the computer
communicate with each other. 
计算机必须有装在主板上的硬件hardware和运行在硬件里的软件software来完成计算

Computers require electricity to function, so they must have a power supply— desktop computers plug into an electrical outlet, and laptop computers can use a battery.
在，通个电？ 

1. When the power button on a computer is pressed, the power supply begins providing electricity to the computer, which begins the process of starting up the computer’s hardware.
2. After the computer’s hardware has started up, the next step is getting the computer’s software ready, beginning with the operating system, which is the software that manages the execution of other programs on the machine
(common operating systems include Windows, macOS, and Linux). 

The operating system, as well as other software and computer files, are stored on the computer’s hard drive, which is the computer’s primary form of storage. 

Each computer also has a Central Processing Unit (CPU), often referred to as the “processor,” which is responsible for running the computer’s software and executing computations.

## Thought Questions

What did you think of those various devices? Can you clearly draw the line between things that are computers and things that are not? 
Ultimately our definition of a computer is this: **A computer is a device that accepts data or input, and processes it in some way to automatically produce a result.**

Before continuing on, consider the following questions:

- What characteristics define a computer?
a device that accepts data or input, and processes it in some way to automatically produce a result.

- What is programming? What are some ways to "program" a machine?
Programming is the process of providing a computer with a set of instructions, or an algorithm, in order to perform a particular task. 
We can program a computer using logical expressions(布尔表达式), binaries(二进制), and even chemical reactions(烟雾报警器的化学反应)

- What devices in your life are computers? Things like phones, desktops, and laptops are more likely "obviously" computers. But what about things like microwaves, dishwashers, remote controls and cars? What else?

# 2. Computer History
Computers compute. That much seems fairly intuitive. But is computing exclusive to computers? When a computer is doing its work to open an application, perform arithmetic operations, or live stream that video for you... what exactly is it doing? What else computes besides computers?

## Thought Questions
Before continuing on, consider the following questions:

- What types of things do you compute every day?
Calculate the mathematical result (；′⌒`)
- When you play video games or even board games, are you computing? What sorts of things are you computing?
yes, computer synthesizes the image through mathematical calculation, determines the position and determine the HP.

- Think specifically about passive computing. What types of things might you do that don't involve you actively using a computer, but still might be considered computing.

- Is it still considered computing if you get the wrong answer? What are the essential components of computing and computation?

反正这个README，没有log，没有api，没有FAQ，也没有contribute。那就把重要的东西写两边吧φ(゜▽゜*)♪

## 前言
我把CC协议换成MIT协议又换成GNU了，我琢磨着这课也是免费的啊，球球你们摇了我吧，爱看英文看不爱看滚出克哈😄
(曾经发生过我的教程被家长传到课外辅导机构的情况所以上GNU了噗)

Because I suck at informal English writing, so....... don't judge me plz ;)
(u can still comment out and help me fix my grammatical error btw)

## What is AP® ???
(加上®之后就感觉特别牛逼了哈哈哈哈)

相信很多人都已经知道AP是啥了(don't look at me, Google it!)
简而言之就是大学一门课要花个几千块，但是呢如果你去参加95刀的AP考试而且通过了，那么你就可以名正言顺的跳课skip了偶欸！最最最关键的是可以省好多好多好多钱啊QWQ

但是呢Max我呢发现一个很奇怪的现象：有很多课外辅导机构(点名Elite！我gf每天都会因为AP培训被困在里面）会去辅导AP课程，但是辅导费一半都是五位数的。我就纳闷了你tm考AP省几千块学AP几万块，正四位数>正五位数，行8，这可能就是传说中的“Crazy Rich Asian”吧👌

于是学校里面穷出名的垃圾佬便开始他的拉帮结派之路哈哈哈

# CS50's AP® Computer Science Principles
这一门AP课程算是美帝良心了，Khan Academy上也有几门AP但是这个，这个这个有哈佛的证书啊可以挂在Linkedin上的哇哈哈哈哈九十美元买哈尔滨佛学院文凭，成了！

This is CS50 AP, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students in high school, which satisfies the College Board's new AP CS Principles curriculum framework.

An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50 AP teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. As of Fall 2015, the on-campus version of CS50 was Harvard's largest course.

Students in high school may receive AP credit for this course provided their school approves the credit and administers the College Board's end-of-year exam. Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project are also eligible to receive a verified certificate from HarvardX.

What You Will Learn:
- A broad and robust understanding of computer science and programming
- How to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently
- Concepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development
- Familiarity in a number of languages, including C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML
- How to engage with a vibrant community of like-minded learners from all levels of experience
- How to develop and present a final programming project to your peers
