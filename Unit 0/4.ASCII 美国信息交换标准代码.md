# Key Terms
- encoding 编码
- ASCII American Standard Code for Information Interchange，美国信息交换标准代码，a standard way of translating characters to and from sequences of binary digits that computers can understand.
- ASCII table  just a table that shows all possible ASCII characters, and which numbers correspond to them.
# Overalls
Computers need a way of storing a variety of types of information, including text. However, since computers can only store data as 0s and 1s, computers need a way of using those 0s and 1s to represent characters in text. **ASCII is a standard way of translating characters to and from sequences of binary digits that computers can understand.**

## ASCII Encoding Standard
**In order to represent characters as numbers, a character encoding standard is used, which gives common characters a unique number to identify them.** ASCII is a common encoding standard, which computers use in order to store text-based data. 

In the standard, the number 65 corresponds to the capital letter 
‘A’. Thus, if a computer wanted to store the capital letter ‘A’, it would need to store the number 65 in binary (which happens to be 1000001). The next 25 values in the ASCII encoding standard represent the other 25 letters, in order: so 66 represents ‘B’, 67 represents ‘C’, and so on.

Lowercase letters also have numerical representations in ASCII. The lowercase letter ‘a’ is represented by the number 97, ‘b’ is represented by 98, and so on. Thus, for a computer to store the lowercase letter ‘a’, it would need to store the number 97 in binary, which is 1100001. 

记住几个重要的数字就行了，0的ASCII是48，大写A是65，小写的a是97，大小写之间的差都是32，打代码要把大写转换为小写直接减去32就完事了，97-32=65

Note that this binary number differs from the binary representation of capital ‘A’ by just one bit: the value in the 32s place. This is because, in ASCII, **lowercase letters are always represented as numbers 32 greater than their respective upper-case letters.** As a result, letters can easily be switched from lower-case to uppercase or vice versa just by switching a single bit—the one in the 32s place—to 1 or 0 ( 1 for lowercase, 0 for uppercase).

There’s no reason why ASCII has to use these exactly values: ultimately, the decision as to what number maps to which letter is arbitrary. What’s important is that the standard is consistent: **any computer can read and understand the numbers the same way.**

## ASCII’s Limits
ASCII is frequently represented on an ASCII table: which is just a table that shows all possible ASCII characters, and which numbers correspond to them.
**The original ASCII table represents all characters using just 7 bits**: which means that there are 27, or 128, possible characters that can be represented in ASCII. Several extensions to ASCII exist which add an 8th bit, allowing for a total of 256 possible characters to be represented. Since there are only 52 letters, this means that ASCII has space to represent other types of characters: like punctuation, numbers, and some basic symbols (like the $ sign or the % sign).

However, event with 8-bit ASCII encoding, there are still a lot of characters that can’t be represented, because there are more than 256 possible characters. For example, **many mathematical symbols and characters in other languages do not fit into the standard ASCII table. As a result, other character encoding standards exist that have far more possible character options**: Unicode, for example, is a character encoding standard that allows for more than 1 million possible characters to be represented. The first 128 characters in Unicode are identical to the 128 characters in ASCII, which makes them compatible with one another.
常见的除了只能代表英文的ASCII之外，还有Unicode，系统cmd里面的gbk，和写程序的时候每次都要设置的UTF-8格式

# Thought Questions
Before moving on, consider the following questions:

Q:Are there things that cannot be represented using binary?
A:smell(they can store sound and video so.....)
Q:What are the impacts of ASCII and Unicode on the usage of technology internationally?
A:
Q:Think about the ASCII table, in particular some of the patterns in it. How might some of those patterns be helpful?
A:（Google ASCII表格有没有什么规律XD）

这破玩意儿就是一张表，硬性规定，谈不上规律，非要说规律就以下几条：
“0”~“9”对应十六进制的：30h ~ 39h
“a”~“z”对应十六进制的：41h ~ 5Ah
“A”~“Z”对应十六进制的：61h ~ 7Ah
o.....k?

Q:Why do we need ASCII at all? What problems might we face if we didn't have it?
A:Well, how could you decode these 01101 shit if you don't have one standard :)

ASCII was written as a 7-bit encoding scheme, but bytes are 8 bits. Why do you think that is? What do you think that might mean about other historical standards?
A: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14690159/is-ascii-code-7-bit-or-8-bit](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14690159/is-ascii-code-7-bit-or-8-bit)
**The original ASCII table is encoded on 7 bits therefore it has 128 characters**
Nowadays most readers/editors use an "extended" ASCII table (from ISO 8859-1), which is encoded on 8 bits and enjoys 256 characters (including Á, Ä, Œ, é, è and other characters useful for european languages as well as mathematical glyphs and other symbols).

Note: A byte was not actually standardized as 8 bits until the 1990s! ASCII was written in 1963.

In most of our messages, are we using all of the characters in the ASCII table? What does this mean in terms of optimization?
Yeeee you still need those chars tho.
